### Dice: Remaining steps
Imagine you are playing a board game. You roll a 6-faced dice and move forward the same number of spaces that you rolled. If the finishing point is “n” spaces away from the starting point, please implement a program that calculates how many possible ways are there to arrive exactly at the finishing point.

```java
Dice.combinationSequence()
Dice.combinationCount()
Dice.combinationCountDP()
```
